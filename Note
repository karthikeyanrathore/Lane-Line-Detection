Introduction
- road with lane lines painted or not-painted.
- straight roads and round curves.
- Algorithm works in extreme weather conditions.
- Road Boundaries are detected by fitting parallel hyperbola pairs to the edges of the lane after applying
some edge detection tech & Hough Transform.

Algorithm
- 620x480 RGB img
- grayscale (to minimize processing time)
- noise reduction (which might hinder the edge detection)
- FHD Algorithm (removes shadows fro images)
- canny filter [edge image == lane detector (prodcue left & right boundary)]
- Hough Transform (series of points on left & right)
- pair of Hyperbola (produce lane lines)


Hough Transform
- HT search for lines. using some equation.
- highlights horizontal lines (common sense)
- each left & right are searched seperatly.
- outputs Hough Lines.
- These Hough Lines are scanned & outputs Left Lane  Points & Right Line Points basically COORDINATES

- They applied 4 tech for lane edges detection
- Roberts
- Prewitt
- Sobel
- Canny

ways to detect lane lines
- Hough Transform
- sliding window polynomial fitting

Hough Transform is good for straight lane lines.
S.W.P much better than HT in curved lines.


Hough Transform

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMK8DjdGtZo
- takes input as edged image & outputs (x, y) pts where there could be a line segment or circle.
