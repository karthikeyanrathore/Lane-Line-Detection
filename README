Introduction
In this Project we are building one of the components of the autonomous driving system (ADS) that is lane line detection on the road. Computer vision plays a very important part in detecting lane lines on the road for autonomous driving. Lane  lines are designed  for humans to follow while driving. In the same way, an autonomous driving system  uses lane lines to steer the vehicle accordingly and follow the road track in the correct orientation. In this Project, we will be implementing various computer vision algorithms to detect real
time lane lines on the road using dataset which includes dashcam footage and dashcam images of the road.

Gihtub
- https://github.com/galenballew/SDC-Lane-and-Vehicle-Detection-Tracking (simple , semi , adv)

Simple
- lane line detect

Semi (better)
- vechile going off lane or not?

Adv.
- vechile detection.
- warn driver to brake when he is close to any object.


Questions
- How much weather conditions impacts/disturbs the lane line detection system?
- How much car, building, tree etc shadows impacts/disturbs the lane line detection system?
- if diff car drives on the lane, will it output something diff?
- Morning, evening, night , will it impact?

Answer
- yes,. All the above Questions are taken
into account while building the system.


ideas
- Our System will warn the driver when he is not in lane. (BEEP SOUND) 
- Our System will assist driver to go slow when there is a curve in the video.
- Our System will assist driver to brake when is close to object.


Might not ignore ideas (additional)
- Build a system which warns drive when he is too close to vehicle which is in front. (autoatic Breaking System).
